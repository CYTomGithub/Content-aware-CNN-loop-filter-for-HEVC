### Content-Aware Convolutional Neural Network for In-loop Filtering in High Efficiency Video Coding (TIP 2019) [[pdf]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8630681)


## Project 
In this paper, we focus on CNN technology joining with image restoration to facilitate video coding performance, and propose the content-aware CNN based in-loop filtering for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). The proposed coding tool and pre-trained models are provided for performance comparison. The Project Page of the paper could found [here](http://www.jiachuanmin.site/Projects/CNNLF/index.html). 

## Dataset
We also provide the HEVC-compressed [dataset](https://github.com/Codersadis/Content-aware-CNN-loop-filter-for-HEVC/tree/master/Trainingdata) for training the proposed method.
